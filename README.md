✅ Task 2 – Landing Page
As part of my Web Development Internship, I designed and developed a professional Landing Page using HTML and CSS. The main objective of this task was to understand page layout, content structuring, and basic styling techniques in front-end development.
This task improved my understanding of semantic HTML elements, page design principles, and how to build a structured and visually appealing webpage using core web technologies.
